/**
 * Browser shell for the PWA. Serves the SAME chat DOM (`chatBodyMarkup`) and
 * styles as the VS Code webview, but as a real web page: no CSP nonce, the
 * client loads as an external `/pwa/app.js` bundle (built by
 * `scripts/build-pwa.mjs` with `./vscode` aliased to the bridge shim), and a
 * manifest + service worker make it installable.
 *
 * Security: this shell is served UNAUTHENTICATED (see `src/api/bridge.ts`), so
 * it must carry no secret and no session data. The bearer token is entered by
 * the user in the browser and lives only in that browser's localStorage — it is
 * never embedded here. Every data endpoint stays Bearer-gated.
