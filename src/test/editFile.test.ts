// Regression tests for the edit_file tool's replacement semantics.
//
// Background (PR #17 by zhiru, applied locally): the single-occurrence path used
// String.replace(oldStr, newStr), which interprets $&, $', $$ … in the
// replacement as special patterns — silently corrupting written code (bash/regex
// strings are full of $). The literal-safe split/join technique is now used for
// both the single and the replace_all paths. These tests pin that behaviour so a
// future "simplification" back to .replace() is caught.

/**
 * The exact replacement primitive used by edit_file (localRun.ts). Kept here as a
